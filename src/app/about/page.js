          Hey there ✰! I’m Muhammad Farooq, a passionate Web Developer 💻 based
          in Pakistan. I spend my time turning ideas into interactive,
          responsive, and impactful digital experiences—making websites not only
          look GREAT but also work even better ☜.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the past year ☟ I’ve been living the ✰ developer dream—taking
          concepts and transforming them into clean, functional, and
          performance-driven code ❀. From front-end design to back-end logic, I
          love building projects that are both creative and technically solid.
        </p>
        <p>
          My focus ✎ is always on creating web experiences that truly connect
          with people. Whether it’s crafting smooth UIs, optimizing performance,
          or solving tough coding challenges, I aim to deliver solutions that
          are meaningful, user-friendly, and unforgettable.
